---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to the **Proto Pack**, a collection of experimental and prototype vehicles for *Project Gotham Racing 2*. This pack contains unique development vehicles that offer a different racing experience, designed specifically for online multiplayer sessions.

## What's in the Proto Pack?

The Proto Pack introduces three experimental vehicles that were part of the development process:

### Car Pack

#### Proto Pack

Experimental and prototype vehicles for unique online racing:

- **Seat F1** - A Formula 1-inspired prototype racer
- **Ben's Prototype** - An experimental development vehicle
- **Pete's Prototype** - An experimental development vehicle

### Online-Only Usage

- **Leaderboards**: Proto Pack cars are **NOT** for use on leaderboards. They are excluded from leaderboard submissions to maintain fair competition.
- **Online Play**: Proto Pack cars are designed exclusively for online multiplayer racing on Insignia.
- **Session Compatibility**: Proto Pack cars will only function if the session host also has both the Lost Cars Pack and Proto Pack installed.

### Installation Requirements

**⚠️ CRITICAL: You MUST install the Lost Cars Pack FIRST before installing the Proto Pack.**

The Proto Pack depends on files and configurations from the Lost Cars Pack. Installing them in the wrong order will cause the mod to malfunction.

## Installation Instructions

Follow these steps to install the Proto Pack:

1. **Install Lost Cars Pack First**: You must install the Lost Cars Pack completely before proceeding. See the Lost Cars Pack README for installation instructions.

2. **Copy Game Files**: After the Lost Cars Pack is installed, copy the files from the Proto Pack to the corresponding locations on your console, overwriting the existing *Project Gotham Racing 2* game files. Note: The full game must be placed on your HDD for this mod to work.

3. **Clear Cache**: Clear your game cache to prevent a "dirty disk" error on the first load. If the error occurs, the cache will be force-cleared, and the game will load correctly on the next attempt.

4. **Use JayFNG Profile**: To access unlocked tracks, use the JayFNG profile. You may need to purchase cars using in-game tokens.

## Important Notes

- **Language Support**: This mod currently supports only English systems. Multi-language support is planned for future updates.

- **Online Usage Only**: The Proto Pack is designed exclusively for online multiplayer racing. Do not use Proto Pack cars in offline modes or for leaderboard submissions.

- **Installation Order**: The Proto Pack **MUST** be installed after the Lost Cars Pack. Installing in the wrong order will cause errors.

- **Car Classes**: All Proto Pack vehicles are organized in Class 18 for easy identification and selection.

- **Session Host Requirements**: For Proto Pack cars to work in online sessions, the session host must have both the Lost Cars Pack and Proto Pack installed. If the host lacks these mods, the cars will not function in the session.
